# n-queens
This repository provides an in-depth approach to solving the classic N-Queens problem using two optimization techniques: Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
